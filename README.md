# simple-calculator
A simple calculator for basic arithmetic. 

Following a cute adventure of helping Fufi count rainbow poofs, the user can perform simple arithmetic operations. The user can add, subtract, multiply, or divide 2 numbers.

### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This calculator allows the user to input two numbers. Next, the user clicks the 'equal' button that will perform the mathematical operation. This is possible because there is an event listener on the 'equal' button that will call a function that will perform the operation. 


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to use event listeners to call functions that will use arithmetic operators. Also, I learned how to use the display property in JavaScript to change what the user sees on their browser after they have picked which problem they wish to solve.
